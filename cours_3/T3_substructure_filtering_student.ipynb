    "Substructures can be unfavorable, e.g. because they are toxic or reactive, due to unfavorable pharmacokinetic properties, or because they likely interfere with certain assays. \n",

    "Hence, reducing a library before screening can **save time and resources**. \n",

    "PAINS ([PAINS wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-assay_interference_compounds)) are compounds that often occur as hits in HTS even though they actually are **false positives** (this notion is first mentioned here, but will be used multiple times later in the course, with the **confusion matrix**).  \n",
    "\n",
    "PAINS tend to **react unspecifically with numerous targets rather than one specific target**.  \n",

    "In this talktorial, we learned two ways to perform a search for unwanted substructures: \n",
    "* Once with the class `FilterCatalog` which is already implemented in RDKit, and \n",
    "* Once with an external list and the `HasSubstructMatch()` function from RDKit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, PAINS could also be implemented via substructure search. And also the list by Brenk et al. is already in RDKit. Further lists that are implemented can be found in the ([RDKit Documentation](http://rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdfiltercatalog.html)). \n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have been using the function `HasSubstructMatch()` which only yields one match per compound. With [`GetSubstructMatches()`](http://www.rdkit.org/Python_Docs/rdkit.Chem.rdchem.Mol-class.html#GetSubstructMatches), we also have the option to find all substructures matching one compound.\n",
    "Similarly for PAINS: We have only looked at the first match `GetFirstMatch()` per molecule. If we want to filter out all PAINS this is enough. However, we could also use `GetMatches()` in order to see all critical substructures of a molecule. Since we did not take all matches per molecule into account, we cannot state that the last substructures we drew, are actually the most frequent ones. However, they definitely do occur very often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Detected substructures can be handled in two different ways. \n",
    "* Either, the substructure search is applied as a filter and the compounds are excluded from further testing to reduce the money and time. \n",
    "* Or, they can be used as warnings. Molecules containing unwanted substructures can be flagged. Expert's (e.g. chemists, toxicologists...) eyes might be able to judge from their experience. If the respective substructures are less critical, they might still include them for screening.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not filter out the unwanted substructures as we do not want to lose too many compounds for machine learning. Also, the substructure filters could still be applied in a later stage before actual experimental screening. There's the possibility to set alert flags, so the information about unfavorable substructures (according to any list, e.g. PAINS or Brenk) could be kept and considered later."
