    "\n",
    "The assumption that structurally similar molecules have similar properties and, thus, similar biological activity is represented in the similarity property principle (SPP) as well as the structure activity relationship (SAR). \n",
    "In this context, virtual screening follows the idea that given a set of molecules with known binding affinity, we can look for further such molecules.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Substructure-based fingerprints\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular fingerprints are a computational representation of molecules that encode chemical and molecular features in form of bitstrings, bitvectors or arrays. Each bit corresponds to a predefined molecular feature or environment, where \"1\" represents the presence and \"0\" the absence of a feature. Note that some implementations are count-based, thus, they count how often a specific feature is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to design fingerprints.\n",
    "Here, we introduce MACCS keys and Morgan fingerprint as two commonly used 2D fingerprints. \n",
    "As can be seen in the [RDKit documentation: Fingerprints](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/GettingStartedInPython.html#list-of-available-fingerprints), RDKit also offers multiple alternate fingerprints. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### MACCS fingerprints\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular ACCess System \n",
    "(MACCS) fingerprints, also termed MACCS structural keys, consist of 166 predefined structural fragments. Each position queries the presence or absence of one particular structural fragment or key. \n",
    "The individual keys were empirically defined by medicinal chemists and are simple to use and interpret ([RDKit documentation: MACCS keys](http://rdkit.org/Python_Docs/rdkit.Chem.MACCSkeys-module.html)).\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Morgan fingerprints and circular fingerprints \n",
    "\n",
    "This family of fingerprints is based on the Morgan algorithm. \n",
    "The bits correspond to the circular environments of each atom in a molecule. \n",
    "The number of neighboring bonds and atoms to consider is set by the radius. \n",
    "Also the length of the bit string can be defined, a longer bit string will be modded to the desired length. \n",
    "Therefore, the Morgan fingerprint is not limited to a certain number of bits. \n",

Chem.</i> (2014), <b>57</b>, 3186-3204](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm401411z)).\n",

    "### Virtual screening \n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge in early stages of drug discovery is to narrow down a set of small molecules (compounds) from the large existing chemical space that are potentially binding to the target under investigation. Note that this chemical space is vast: Small molecules can be made of 10<sup>20</sup> combinations of chemical moieties ([<i>ACS Chem. Neurosci.</i> (2012), <b>19</b>, 649-57](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23019491)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Since experimental high-throughput screening (HTS) for the activity of all those small molecules against the target of interest is cost and time intensive, computer-aided methods are invoked to propose a focused list of small molecules to be tested. This process is called virtual (high-throughput) screening: a large library of small molecules is filtered by rules and/or patterns, in order to identify those small molecules that are most likely to bind a target under investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Virtual screening using similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing a set of novel molecules against a (or several) known active molecule(s) to find the most similar ones can be used as a simple way of virtual screening. \n",
    "Given the similar property principle, we can assume that the most similar molecules, e.g. to a known inhibitor, also have similar effects. Requirements for a similarity search are the following (as discussed in detail above):\n",
    "\n",
    "* A representation that encodes chemical/molecular features\n",
    "* A potential weighting of features (optional)\n",
    "* A similarity measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "A similarity search can be performed by calculating the similarity between one compound and all compounds in a specific database. Ranking the compounds of the database by their similarity coefficient yields the most similar molecules at the top.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Enrichment plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Enrichment plots are used to validate virtual screening results, which display the ratio of active compounds detected in the top x% of the ranked list, i.e.: \n",
