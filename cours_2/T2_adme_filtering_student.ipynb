    "In a virtual screening we can predict whether a compound might bind to and interact with a specific target. However, if we want to identify a new drug, it is also important that this compound reaches the target and is eventually removed from the body in a favorable way. Therefore, we should also consider whether a compound is actually taken up into the body and whether it is able to cross certain barriers in order to reach its target. Is it metabolically stable and how will it be excreted once it is not acting at the target anymore? These processes are investigated in the field of pharmacokinetics. In contrast to pharmacodynamics ('What does the drug do to our body?'), pharmacokinetics deals with the question **'What happens to the drug in our body?'**. \n",
    "\n",
    "### ADME\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharmacokinetics are mainly divided into four steps: \n",
    "<strong>A</strong>bsorption, \n",
    "<strong>D</strong>istribution, \n",
    "<strong>M</strong>etabolism, and \n",
    "<strong>E</strong>xcretion. \n",
    "These are summarized as <strong>ADME</strong>. Sometimes, ADME(T) also includes <strong>T</strong>oxicology. \n",
    "Below, the ADME steps are discussed more detailed.  \n",
    "([ADME wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADME) and [<i>Mol Pharm.</i> (2010), <b>7(5)</b>, 1388-1405](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3025274/))\n",

    "* **Absorption**: The amount and the time it takes for a substance to be taken up into the body depends on multiple factors which can vary between individuals and their conditions as well as on the properties of the substance. Factors such as (poor) compound solubility, gastric emptying time, intestinal transit time, chemical (in-)stability in the stomach, and (in-)ability to permeate the intestinal wall can all influence the extent to which a drug is absorbed after e.g. oral administration, inhalation or contact to skin.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* **Distribution**: The distribution of an absorbed substance, i.e. within the body, between blood and different tissues, and crossing of the blood-brain barrier are affected by regional blood flow rates, molecular size and polarity of the compound, and binding to serum proteins and transporter enzymes. Critical effects in toxicology can be accumulation of highly apolar substances in fatty tissue, or crossing of the blood-brain barrier.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* **Metabolism**: As soon as a compound enters the body, it usually starts to be metabolized. This means that only part of this compound will actually reach its target. Mainly liver and  kidney enzymes are responsible for the break down of xenobiotics (substances that are extrinsic to the body).  Reducing the amount of an absorbed substance can be favorable if a toxic compound is removed. On the other hand, transformation of a chemical could even yield new toxic metabolites. \n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* **Excretion**: Compounds and their metabolites need to be removed from the body via excretion, usually through the kidneys (urine) or in the feces. Incomplete excretion can result in accumulation of foreign substances or adverse interference with normal metabolism.\n",

    "\n",
    "Hydrophobic molecules might have a reduced solubility in water, while more hydrophilic molecules (e.g. high number of hydrogen bond acceptors and donors) or large molecules (high molecular weight) might have more difficulties in passing phospholipid membranes.\n",
