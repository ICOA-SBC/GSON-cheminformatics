Model.*(1999), 39(4), 747](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci9803381)) was developed to identify **smaller but homogeneous** clusters, with the prerequisite that (at least) the cluster centroid will be more similar than a **given threshold** to every other molecule in the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the key steps in this clustering approach (see flowchart below):\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data preparation and compound encoding\n",
    "* To identify chemical similarities, the compounds in the input data (e.g. given as SMILES) will be encoded as molecular fingerprints, e.g., RDK5 fingerprint which is a subgraph-based fingerprint similar to the well known [Daylight Fingerprint](/http://www.daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.finger.html) (which was used in the original publication).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Tanimoto similarity (or distance) matrix\n",
    "* The similarity between two fingerprints is calculated using the Tanimoto coefficient.\n",
    "* Matrix with Tanimoto similarities between all possible molecule/fingerprint pairs (n*n similarity matrix with n=number of molecules, upper triangle matrix used only)\n",
    "* Equally, the **distances matrix** can be calculated (1 - similarity)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Clustering molecules: Centroids and exclusion spheres \n",
    "Note: Molecules will be clustered together, if they have a maximum distance below a specified cut-off from the cluster centroid (if distance matrix is used) or if they have a minimum similarity above the specified cut-off (if similarity matrix is used).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Identification of potential cluster centroids**\n",
    "    * The cluster centroid is the molecule within a given cluster which has the **largest number of neighbors**.\n",
    "    * Annotate neighbors: For each molecule count all molecules with a Tanimoto distance below a given threshold.\n",
    "    * Sort the molecules by their number of neighbors in descending order, so that potential cluster centroids (i.e. the compounds with the largest number of neighbors) are placed at the top of the file.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering based on the exclusion spheres**\n",
    "    * Starting with the first molecule (centroid) in the sorted list\n",
    "        * All molecules with a Tanimoto index above or equal to the cut-off value used for clustering then become members of that cluster (in case of similarity).\n",
    "            * Each molecule that has been identified as a member of the given cluster is **flagged and removed from further comparisons**. Thus, flagged molecules cannot become either another cluster centroid or a member of another cluster. This process is **like putting an exclusion sphere** around the newly formed cluster.\n",
    "            * Once the first compound in the list has found all its neighbors, the first available (i.e. not flagged) compound at the top of the list becomes the new cluster centroid.\n",
    "        * The same process is repeated for all other unflagged molecules down the list.\n",
    "    * Molecules that have not been flagged by the end of the clustering process become singletons.\n",
