  question:
    text: "About PCA"
  options:
    - text: "PCA is a dimensionality reduction tool"
      correct: true
    - text: "You don't lose any information by looking only at the main 2 principal components"
    - text: "It can be used to compare two (or more) groups of data"
      correct: true
    - text: "descriptors should be normalized before carrying out a PCA"
      correct: true

question-02:
  type: QuizQuestion
  score: 1
  question:
    text: "About the correlation circle"
  options:
    - text: "The correlation circle is used to see the correlation of descriptors with the components"
      correct: true
    - text: "The contribution of a descriptor for a component depend on the cos2 of the descriptor for that component"
      correct: true
    - text: "A descriptor's vector ending close to the center of a correlation circle means that the descriptor is badly described by the 2 principal components used"
      correct: true
    - text: "Two vectors going into opposite directions are called correlated"

  type: QuizQuestion
  score: 1
  question:
    text: "About PCA"
  options:
    - text: "Using the cumulative component contributions inertia, we select principals components required to reach 80% of inertia"
      correct: true
    - text: "There is as many principal components as descriptors but we usually analyse only a few of them"
      correct: true
    - text: "All components are orthogonal to eachother"
      correct: true
