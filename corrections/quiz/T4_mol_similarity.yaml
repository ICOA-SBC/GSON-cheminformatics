  question:
    text: "Among the following statements, which is true about fingerprints"
  options:
    - text: "Molecular fingerprints are a computational representation of molecules"
      correct: true
    - text: "Molecular fingerprints encode chemical and molecular features in form of bitstrings, bitvectors or arrays"
      correct: true
    - text: "Usually, in a molecular fingerprint, \"0\" represents the presence and \"1\" the absence of a molecular feature"
